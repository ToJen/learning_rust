// My first program in a new language is usually not 'hello world' ;)

// run with `rustc hellp.rs` then `./hello`
fn main() { // the usual entry point with most langs
    println!("I don't want to get rust-y :p"); // the `!` is new...hmm
    print!("Seems like i can't compile without an exclamation mark, oh wait i didn't use a semicolon...javascript sigh!")
